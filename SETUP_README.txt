Execute the following steps :
    From the base directory run, 
        python setup.py sdist

    This will create a directory called dist inside the base. That directory will contain kritter-<version>.tar.gz
    Untar it and put the contents within /usr/share/kritter

For any release of twig or data_structs, the above step will be required on all machines
